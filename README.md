San Maria Tunes
Music Management System - DBMS Project (Summer 2024 Semester)
This project, developed during the Summer 2024 semester, is a Music Management System designed to manage artist information, playlists, and concert bookings.
Features

User Sign-up and Login: Users first sign up and then log in using their username and date of birth.

Admin Access: After logging in, users are assigned an artist code. Each artist code corresponds to a unique artist, allowing for registration of the artist's details.

Playlist Creation and Concert Booking: Once logged in, users can create playlists and book concert tickets, where they can perform CRUD operations such as create, read, update, and delete entries.

Technologies Used
We utilized Flask API for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap templates for the frontend.
